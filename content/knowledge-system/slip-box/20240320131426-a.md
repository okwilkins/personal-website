Oftentimes, it's easy to look at a piece of code, think that an idiot wrote it and to then be tempted to change or remove it. As codebases can be vast and complex, it's easy to not fully understand the full picture. Removing a piece of code you don't understand can later lead to the discovery that the code was there for a reason that you didn't foresee before.
