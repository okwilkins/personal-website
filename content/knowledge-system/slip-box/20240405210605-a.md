To optimise image size with Docker files, look at this example:

````dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine as base
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=base /app /app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 3002
CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
````

See how the last stage doesn't include the `node:14-alpine` image and instead uses the `alpine:latest`image. This significantly cuts down the size of the overall image. Only the binaries from the `base` stage are needed. Everything that comes with the `node:14-alpine` image is not included.
